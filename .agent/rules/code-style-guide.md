Everytime you add something new, make sure it doesnt break previous functionality. If you change or remove something, that should no longer be used, be sure to remove it completely so that it doesnt confuse you in the future. 
Make sure that the code can be ran everytime, no tsc errors present, check it everytime before finishing with changes.
